Ported from Obsidian, all credits for the theme and its colors go to the original author -> https://github.com/RuslanGagushin/Tokyo-Night-Obsidian-Theme

## Color Choices elements in Logseq
The choice of colors that went into the various elements of LS actually have some thought and reasoning behind them that came from [site](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/how-do-colors-influence-learning). 

The idea is to promote a visually appealing experience, while building an environment that's distraction free (flat style) with colors that promote capturing the user's attention and boosting mental productivity.
